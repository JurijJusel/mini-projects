# Kivy Calculator mini Project

## Overview----
This is a simple calculator application built using [Kivy](https://kivy.org/),
a Python framework for creating cross-platform GUI applications.
The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division). It is designed as a beginner-friendly project
to learn Kivy, developed using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and Python 3.12.5.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- User-friendly interface, operators, and clear/equals functions
- Scrollable display for long expressions
- **Calculation History**: Displays a persistent history of calculations
    (e.g., `2 + 3 = 5`) in a scrollable display, with the current input shown below.
    The history is cleared only when the `C` button is pressed.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile platforms
- Built with Python 3.12.5 and Kivy 2.3.1
